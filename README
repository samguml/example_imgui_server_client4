A simple test program for C sockets using imgui backend. The backend is also built as a static library, please clone with --recurse-submodules to obtain
my fork (a copy, with some Make magic and file rearrangements) of Omar Cornut's Dear ImGui (with glfw backend only).

Execute make in the directory to compile. Requires libglfw3.
